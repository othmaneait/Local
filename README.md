# Red And Green - YouTube API download / upload

<b>YouTube Channel Video, Description, and Thumbnail Downloader : (Linux Version)</b>
<b>ytapithumbget.py</b>

<b>YouTube Channel Video Description Uploader : (Linux Version)</b>
<b>upload_video3.py</b>

To use this you will have to make your own file called apikey.py and put it in the same directory as ytapithumbget.py

The format needs to be 

api_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" 

where the xxxx is YOUR YouTube API key that you get from them...
It needs to be in quotes too, as it is a string in Python.

To run, just type the following from your terminal shell:

<b>python3 ytapithumbget.py<b>
  
It will prompt you for a folder name to store the saved images in - this folder will be created inside a 'youtube_downloads' folder in your installation directory.

Next : run update_video3.py, make sure you have the right "_desc.json" file in the directory where you run these scripts from.
You can find the correct file for this in the folder that you made when you ran "ytapithumbget.py"
